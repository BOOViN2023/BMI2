        <h1>BMI CALCULATOR</h1>
        <p>A BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator is a valuable health assessment tool that measures an individual's body fat based on their weight and height. It serves as a screening tool to identify potential health risks related to weight, such as obesity or being underweight. Once you input your weight and height, the BMI calculator provides a numerical value that falls into different categories, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. While it does not directly measure body fat, BMI remains a widely used and practical tool for quickly assessing weight-related health risks and determining potential areas for improvement.</p>
